Today was such a unique day -- new day, a new role, a new lifestyle, and new people. I have been to a handful of schools in my life, but I have never seen a more majestic school than this one. They have an amphitheatre, an innovation centre, big labs, two libraries, close to a hundred classrooms and two campuses. 

I was struck by how kind the staff were -- both with us and within themselves. The students are quite enthusiastic and confident. When chatting about science with 6th graders, one said they wanted to do robotics; another wanted to become a zoologist! I'm just so happy that they don't see engineering and medicine alone as career opportunities. They get exposed to a lot of real-world stuff -- hackathons, climate change-related open days, etc. I wish I were a student at this school. 

There were so many other incidents, people and observations I could be writing about, but I'm tired. I didn't even teach, but the day wore me down. 

The vice principal rightly pointed out that we need to define what we want to get out of this internship. We will have to carve the experience for ourselves. I had written some goals in the background post, but now I realize that I was being too general. I should probably jot down a few more specific tasks. I'll do it over the weekend. It'll only get harder from now on.
