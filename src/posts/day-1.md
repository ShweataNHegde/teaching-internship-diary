Today was such an unique day -- new day, new role, new lifestyle, new people. I have been to a handful of schools in my life, but I have never seen a more majestic school than this one. They have an amphitheater, an innovation centre, big labs, two libraries close to hundred classrooms and two campuses. 

I was struck by the kindess of staff towards us and ofcourse towards each other. The students are quite enthusiastic and confident. When talking about science to 6th graders, one said they wanted to do robotics, the other wanted to become a zoologist and so on! I'm just so happy that they don't see engineering and medicine alone as career opportunities. They are also exposed to a lot of real word stuff -- hackathons, climate change related open days, etc. I so wish I studied at a school like this one!

There were so many other incidents, people and observations I could be writing about, but I'm tired. I didn't even teach, but the day has wore me down. 

The vice principal rightly pointed out that we need to define what we want to get out of this internship. We will have to carve the experience for ourselves. I had written some goals in background post, but now I realize that I was being too general. I should probably jot down few more achievables. I'll do it over the weekend. It'll only get harder from now on...
