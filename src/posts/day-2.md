I woke up today with some specific goals in mind probably as a result of rumincating over my thoughts way too much. 
- Academic -- do whatever the college wants me do; integrate work related to my project as much as possible
- Project -- host a podcast-making session; run Climate Knowledge Hunt Hackathon (very ambitious)
- Personal -- communicate better

I didn't have time to jot them down until I reached school because I spent all the time in the morning draping. I did it all by myself! I spent today observing two classroom transactions (the students already know so much!), discussing the units to handle from next week, chatting with Atal Tinkering Lab facilitator and the vice principal. 

 Atal Tinkering Lab facilitator gave me a quick tour of the space and proudly showed projects students had made. He gave me a lecture about why he felt innovation to be distruptive. I don't fully agree with him, but I didn't talk much. 

The conversation with the V.P. was interesting. I went to her cabin in the afternoon and without taking a pause, I just blurted out all my ideas and goals. I'm now embarassed about how the conversation went. But she was happy that I was buzzing with enthusiasm. Like a good teacher, she also nicely pointed out what how I could have spoken to her better. Here are what she thought I lacked: 
- eye contact
- paused
- emphathy

The teachers like always were incredibly nice and supportive.
