For those who don't know, I study at [Regional Institute of Education, Mysore](https://www.riemysore.ac.in/). As a part of my B.Sc.B.Ed. course, I have to mandatorily teach for two months. Growing up, I have always that silent person whose existense is barely noticed. Although I've come so far from who I was at school, talking confidently to a large group of people doesn't come so naturally.  So, teaching for a class full of energetic teenagers is going to be an interesting challenge and a learning experience. 

My goals -- apart from surviving wearing saree everyday -- would be to: 
- blog my experience everyday
- understand high schoolers and the environment at a well off school 
- try bringing latest science to classrooms
- network and find collaborators 

Good luck to me and all my fellow classmates. I hope I come out as a better communicator/educator than I am on this day as I write.
