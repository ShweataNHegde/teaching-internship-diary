For those who don't know, I study at [Regional Institute of Education, Mysore](https://www.riemysore.ac.in/). As a part of my integrated education course, I have to teach for two months. Growing up, I always have been that person who barely speaks up. Although I've come far from who I was a few years ago, talking confidently to a large group of people doesn't come so naturally. So, teaching a class full of energetic teenagers will be an exciting challenge and a learning experience. I hope I become a better communicator/educator than I am today as I write. 

Apart from not messing up anything for the students and surviving wearing a saree every day, my goals for the next two months would be to: 
- blog my experience every day
- understand high schoolers and the environment at a well-off school 
- try bringing the latest science to classrooms
- [IAW] network and find collaborators 

 Good luck to all my classmates and, of course, me.
